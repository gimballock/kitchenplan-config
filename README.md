## Patrick's dev environment setup

This is a pretty straightforward (honestly, rip-off) of the [Kitchenplan](https://github.com/kitchenplan/kitchenplan) and the example [Kitchenplan Config](https://github.com/roderik/kitchenplan-config).  My main goal was to get back up and running as soon as I could after resets and wipes of my machine either on purpose (e.g. I screwed it up) or as a result of the decisions of others (e.g. Genius bar debugging).

So what's here?  Here's the big hitlist of what I currently care about:

* Developer Stuff
  * Git
  * python tooling and setup
  * AWS CLI
  * Vagrant and VirtualBox
  * Sublime Text themes and packages
* General Stuff
  * Google drive
  * Evernote
  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Appcleaner
  * Snagit
  * Lastpass
  * Join.me
  * Omnigraffle
